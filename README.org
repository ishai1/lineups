#+TITLE: Soccer Lineup Generator

A Python-based tool for generating optimal soccer lineups based on player attributes and constraints.

* Features
- Generates multiple lineup combinations for a given roster.
- Offers two optimization modes:
  - *Fairness*: Prioritizes equal playing time for all players.
  - *Multi-Objective*: Maximizes fairness first, then maximizes total lineup quality.
- Optimizes lineups based on player quality scores (Defense, Offense, Striker).
- Enforces constraints such as minimum quality scores for defense, offense, and the total line.
- Supports footedness constraints to ensure players are in appropriate positions.
- Allows for customizable game parameters (number of halves, lines per half).

* Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    #+begin_src sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    #+end_src
2.  Install the dependencies using Poetry:
    #+begin_src sh
    poetry install
    #+end_src

* Usage
The script is run from the command line and accepts several arguments.

**Basic Usage**
To generate a lineup schedule, run the `lineup_generator.py` script. You can specify the optimization mode using the `--mode` flag.

- To run in *fairness* mode (default):
  #+begin_src sh
  poetry run python lineup_generator.py --mode fairness
  #+end_src

- To run in *multi-objective* mode:
  #+begin_src sh
  poetry run python lineup_generator.py --mode multi-objective
  #+end_src

**All Options**
#+begin_src sh
usage: lineup_generator.py [-h] [--mode {fairness,multi-objective}] [--roster ROSTER] [--num_halfs NUM_HALFS] [--lines_per_half LINES_PER_HALF]
